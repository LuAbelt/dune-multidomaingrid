## Changes

### MultiDomainGrid 2.3

* First "official" release.

* New storage policy that supports specifying the maximum number of subdomains at runtime.

* Support for building with CMake.

* Compatibility with DUNE 2.3.x.

* Some minor bugfixes.


## Caveats

The following list is a non-exhaustive overview of possible problems you might
encounter with the current release.


### General

* Compile times can be really long for non-trivial problems. Some developers
  have had good success with using the clang compiler instead of GCC during
  development and bug-testing to reduce compile times.

* After MultiDomainGrid 2.3, the minimum compiler requirement of MultiDomainGrid
   will be increased to GCC 4.7. Please be aware of this change in minimum requirements.
