license information.

If you need help, please ask via [GitHub][2]) If you find bugs, you can also
submit them to the [bugtracker][3]. Even better, if you have managed to fix a
problem, open a [pull request][4] to get your patch merged into the library.


Changes

### MultiDomainGrid 3.0

* Bump compiler requirements to GCC 4.7.

* Compatiblity with DUNE 3.0-git.


### MultiDomainGrid 2.3

Caveats
-------

The following list is a non-exhaustive overview of possible problems you might
encounter with the current release.


### General

* Compile times can be really long for non-trivial problems. Some developers
  have had good success with using the clang compiler instead of GCC during
  development and bug-testing to reduce compile times.
